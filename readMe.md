# White Space and Tab Encoding and Decoding

This project provides two Python scripts for encoding and decoding data using white spaces and tabs, with data transfer occurring through a text file. One script acts as the sender (encoder), and the other as the receiver (decoder).

## Sender (Encoder)

The sender script (`sender.py`) takes plain text as input and encodes it using the following rules:
- Space (' ') is encoded as '0'.
- Tab ('\t') is encoded as '1'.
- Other characters remain unchanged.

### Usage

1. Open `sender.py` in a text editor.
2. Modify the `input_text` variable to contain your desired input text.
3. Specify the `output_file` variable to define the path of the output file where the encoded data will be saved.
4. Save the script.
5. Run `sender.py` using a Python interpreter.

Example:
```python
python sender.py
```

## Receiver (Decoder)

The receiver script (`receiver.py`) reads the encoded data from the output file generated by the sender script and decodes it back to the original text. The decoding rules are as follows:

- '0' is decoded as a space (' ').
- '1' is decoded as a tab ('\t').
- Other characters remain unchanged.

### Usage

1. Open `receiver.py` in a text editor.
2. Specify the `input_file` variable to define the path to the file containing the encoded data.
3. Save the script.
4. Run `receiver.py` using a Python interpreter.

Example:
```python
python receiver.py
